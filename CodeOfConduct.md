# Code of Conduct

Hi all, and welcome to term_scanner! Here are a few ground rules you must follow if you wish to contribute to this open-source library.

#### 1. Don't eliminate functionality!

It's really important that if we're adding stuff we don't take away functionality already in the code.
#### 2. Comment your code!

Please make sure that your code is easy to understand for me and for anyone else that might be looking at it in the future if it gets merged with pre-existing code.

#### 3. Please respect the boundaries of existing classes

If you want to add functionality, that's great! But, unless it falls under the categories of `ProblemScanner.java` or `VersionComparison.java`, it doesn't belong in those files. You can feel free to add additional classes for review, but if they don't fit with the overall theme of the project, they won't be accepted.

#### 4. Be civil at all times.

Obviously, there's not too much conversation happening around this library, but in comments on pull requests and errors, please keep a respectful tone at all times and be sure to be constructive in your critiques. It's really important that this space remain comfortable for all who wish to contribute.
